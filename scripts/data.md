# Collecting data

## Downloading data from BOM

To get started, you need to download some climate data to train on from BOM. Gi to their [Climate data](http://reg.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) page, find a location and download the maximum temperature and rain fall data for all years. Rename one to `rain.zip` and the other to `temp.zip` and put them in the scripts folder.

## Parsing

There is a script included to clean up the data. You can run this with `yarn data`.
